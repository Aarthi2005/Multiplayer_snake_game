This project implements a multiplayer Snake game that allows players to connect and play in real-time over a network. The architecture follows a client-server model, where the server (server.py) manages game state, synchronization, and player actions, while the client application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and networking capabilities to connect players. The game utilizes Python's socket programming for network communication and JSON-based configuration files to support user preferences and screen settings. This project aims to demonstrate real-time multiplayer game mechanics and networked interactions, providing a foundation for further enhancements in multiplayer gaming applications.
